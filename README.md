Assignment: Expandable Table
Your task is to create an expandable table component in React that allows users to compress rows based on a given time period (e.g. month, quarter, year) and view the aggregated data.

Requirements:
1. Your component should accept an array of data objects with properties representing the time period (e.g. month, quarter, year) and other relevant data.
Example data:

```json
[
    { "month": "January", "indicators":[{"name":"revenue","value": 10000},{"name":"expenses","value": 8000}] },
    { "month": "February",  "indicators":[{"name":"revenue","value": 12000},{"name":"expenses","value": 10000}]  },
    { "month": "March", "indicators":[{"name":"revenue","value": 9000},{"name":"expenses","value": 7000}]   },
    { "month": "April", "indicators":[{"name":"revenue","value": 11000},{"name":"expenses","value": 9000}]   },
    { "month": "May", "indicators":[{"name":"revenue","value": 8000},{"name":"expenses","value": 6000}]   },
    { "month": "June",  "indicators":[{"name":"revenue","value": 14000},{"name":"expenses","value": 12000}]  }
]
```
2. Your table should display the data in a tabular format with columns representing the time period and relevant data properties.
Example table:

```yaml
|	     |January|February|March| April|May  | June  |
|Revenue | 	10000|	12000 |	9000| 11000|8000 |	14000|
|Expenses|	8000 |	10000 |	7000| 9000 |6000 |	12000|
```
3. Your table should allow users to click on a given time period (e.g. month) to compress the table and display aggregated data (e.g. quarterly or yearly).

Example compressed table (by quarter):
```yaml
|	     |   Q1  |  Q2    |
|Revenue | 	31000|	25000 |
|Expenses|	32000|	27000 |
```

4. Your table should allow users to click on the compressed data to expand the table back to the original format.

Bonus:
* Allow users to customize the time period used for compression (e.g. month, quarter, year).
* Add animations to the expansion and compression of the table.
